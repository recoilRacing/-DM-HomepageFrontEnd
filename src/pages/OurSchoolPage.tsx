                <p>The "St√§dtisches Marie-Therese-Gymnasium" currently has an enrollment of approximately 1000 students, who are instructed by 94 teachers, including 34 STEM teachers. Since 2016, the school has maintained a distinct scientific profile. This academic offering is complemented by a range of other programs that contribute to comprehensive education, including theater, art, and music. Moreover, the school offers Chinese as a third foreign language, which aligns with STEM subjects and prepares students for the future.</p>

                <p>In addition to its rigorous curriculum, the school actively engages the community through numerous high-profile events, establishing itself as a renowned institution for the natural sciences. In the summer of 2012, the school achieved a remarkable feat by generating a voltage of over 1,200 V from a potato battery during a spectacular evening event attended by more than 2,500 visitors, securing a place in the Guinness Book of Records. "Wissenschaft macht Schule" (Science conceives School) has been our flagship project for many years!

                <p>Since 2018, we have proudly been a partner in the MINT EC network. Our diverse activities encompass various areas, including the ScienceLAB in middle school, robotics, ecology, and urban gardening in early high school, and a wide range of courses in later high school, such as biochemical internships, microcontroller projects, and alternative curricula like biophysics (in collaboration with the medical city of Erlangen) and astrophysics. We organize scientific excursions and collaborate with esteemed partners in P- and W-seminars, including Siemens AG, Fraunhofer IIS, Nuremberg and Bamberg observatories, TH Nuremberg, and EAM Labs at FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg.</p>
